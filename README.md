# ðŸ“° NewsMonkey

A React-based news application that delivers the latest news articles from multiple categories such as **Business, Entertainment, Health, Science, Sports, and Technology**. 

## ðŸŒŸ Idea
The goal of NewsMonkey is to create a simple, user-friendly platform for reading categorized news in real-time.  
It demonstrates the use of React components, routing, state management, and API integration.

## âš¡ Working
- A **Navbar** allows users to switch between categories.
- On each route change, the app fetches fresh news data from **NewsAPI**.
- A **top loading bar** indicates progress while news is being loaded.
- News articles are displayed in a clean, card-based UI with headlines, images, and descriptions.
- Categories include:
  - General
  - Business
  - Entertainment
  - Health
  - Science
  - Sports
  - Technology
